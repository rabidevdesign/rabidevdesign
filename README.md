# My HTML Learning Journey 🌐

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my repository where I'm practicing and learning the basics of **HTML**. This is a space for me to explore how web pages are built using simple HTML elements and structure.

## 🌱 What I’m Learning

- Basic HTML page structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- Paragraphs and text formatting (`<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`)
- Lists (ordered `<ol>` and unordered `<ul>`)
- Links and images (`<a>`, `<img>`)
- Tables (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`)
- Forms (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, etc.)

## 🛠️ Projects

Here are some small HTML projects I’m working on:

- A personal bio page
- A basic contact form
- A simple table of favorite movies
- A practice page with lists and links

## 💡 Goals

- Get comfortable with HTML syntax and structure
- Create clean and accessible web pages
- Prepare for learning CSS and JavaScript

## 📁 How to Use

Feel free to look around, open the `.html` files in your browser, and learn with me! If you're also starting out, you can fork this repo and use it as a template for your own journey.
